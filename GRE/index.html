         <h2>GRE Study Guide and Resources</h2>

         <h4>Follow and Read this Study Guide Attentively</h4>

         <ul>
            <li>Book (A) Official GRE study guide /textbook </li>
            <li> Book B) Princeton Review GRE book.</li>
            <li> Why 2 GRE books ? Each of the books books is amazingly good for content study
               for the material on the test ( English and Mathematics)</li>

            <li> I do not recommend burdening yourself with many books for content material study</li>
            <li> For English and mathematics, I suggest you take a day or two and brush through the
               first 10-20 pages of both books A and B above to decide which one aligns best with
               your learning style. Then stick to that for consistent content material study .</li>

            <li>As you go through either book , each topic will have sample practice questions as
               well as the end of chapter review</li>

            <li>When youâ€™re done , you use BOTH books for mock practice</li>
            <li> At the end of each book are two sample full length paper-based GRE exams to helpyou simulate your readiness.</li>
            <li> During mock practice I recommend you use the mock sets at the end of books A&B.</li>
            <li> Each book has an online or computer-based mock- S</li>
            <li> The Official GRE guide book has 2 online mock system known as POWERPREPwhere you get to test your readiness FREE OF CHARGE</li>
            <li>Before you go the official GRE exams test center, try your hands on POWERPREP</li>
            <li>The Princeton Review book has about 8-14 or so online mocks to get ready</li>
            <li>Because the GRE is computer based, It Is Strongly Recommend That You Take All The Powerprep As Well As Princeton Review Online Based MockSimulatio</li>
            <li>The essay topics on the GRE are taken from already published essay bank</li>
            <li>Vocabulary worldlists provided in alphabetical /mixed order for</li>
         </ul>
