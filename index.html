   <h1>Welcome To Scholarship Access </h1>
   <p>
    SAT Scholarship Outreach Project in Ghana is aimed at opening arms to  talented and ambitious high school students from relatively underprivileged homes.  Smart students who would not have considered SAT simply due to anticipated financial roadblocks related to SAT study material, registration fee and or college application fees. 
    Let's change Ghana by bringing opportunities to intellectually deserving ones.
    With a goal of exposing as many students as possible to upward mobility opportunities through merit-based scholarships, the project is run in  stages:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Stage 1:</strong>Free SAT study materials with detailed study guide are provided to interested students regardless of where they attended high school.
            Students are given access to these books.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Stage 2:</strong>Students take monthly mock exams to improve their speed on the test and to show theyâ€™re actually studying the material.  In August 2019, about 200 students from all 10 regions in Ghana participated in August SAT national mega-mock exam with a goal of decentralizing scholarship access opportunities to deserving students in every part of the country! Mock exams will be held in all 10 regions at designated schools listed below in June, July and August and students who have seriously studied the material will be invited to come to test their knowledge. 
             Invitation to come for the mock exams is announced on the Scholarship Access Group page (see the Telegram link shared  below at the end of the report)

        <h3>Purpose</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>
             Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
             Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
             It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
             like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
